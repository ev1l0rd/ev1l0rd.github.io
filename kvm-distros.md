Note: I am not responsible for what you do with these distro's. Just don't redistribute them with proprietary packages on it. They're meant for testing out webserver programs or trying out distro's. A VM will have lower preformance than having the system actually installed.

Currently available VMs:

- Ubuntu 14.04 (LTS)
