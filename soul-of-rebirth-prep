The Soul of Rebirth is a mode for Final Fantasy that was included in the GBA rerelease. This mode has later been reimplemented for the PSP version. I hope that with this guide I can help you set up and prepare for the Soul of Rebirth, as you need to take a few actions before you get there! So let's jump into it.

# Characters
In Soul of Rebirth, you receive 4 characters. Nobody leaves the party once they join for some kind of personal quest. That being said, all 4 characters have appeared in the game before, but all died for one reason or another. Let's have a closer look at them, and my advice for what you should do with them.

## Minwu
Minwu is the first character you get to play as in this 'bonus pack'. His stats will be identical since he first left your party, so they will be rather low for what you are supposed to do here. Training him before you start Soul of Rebirth is critical.

### What equipment to give Minwu?
As Minwu is an early game character, you sadly do not have acces to much. Let him keep his spells, they will be useful in Soul of Rebirth. Aside from that, here is my suggested equipment:
* Hand: Staff Of Light (His ultimate weapon, read below)/Mythril sword
* Hand: Mythril Shield
* Helmet: Mythril Helm
* Armor: Golden Armor (failing this, try Mythril. It can be obtained from the Captains in Fynn)
* Arms: Mythril Gloves

As you can see, right now we don't have much in variaton here, with Minwu mostly getting kitted out in Mythril. The Gold Armor will however make the beginning more bearable. You do need to fight Captains in Fynn for a chance of getting one, so that can take a while to obtain. The Staff of Light is a staff type weapon, and is the only weapon he can equip. Getting it can take a while though so feel free to substitute it for the Mythril sword.

All in all Minwu's gear is dependant on how much time you are willing to invest in him.

### Usefulness in Soul of Rebirth
Minwu will be your primary damage-dealer in Soul of Rebirth on the magical front. This is because when you get him, he already comes equipped with nearly every magic spell in the book. Later on in Soul of Rebirth you get the Ultima Tome for the second time. I recommend that you teach it to Minwu, as Ultima is dependant on the level of other spells, and Minwu's spells are all around level 5 and 6 when you get him. Makes that spell looks more useful now doesn't it?

As for his spells, the only one that loses it's shine is Teleport, because there is no overworld map. Replace it with Holy.


## Scott
Scott is interesting. Remember Gordon from the original? Well if you recall correctly, he had a brother. You met him once in his dieing moments, where he gave you the map. Scott, fortunately doesn't suck compared to Gordon and is a worthwile character to raise.

### What equipment does he have?
Scott's gear is predetermined.
* Hand: Mythril Sword
* Hand: Mythril Shield
* Helmet: Mythril Helmet
* Armor: Mythril Armor
* Arms: Mythril Gloves

Mythril. That is the gear Scott has when you get him. Whilst it isn't bad, it also isn't good for what you are going to be up against soon. Fortunately, Soul of Rebirth permits you to get better gear for him. Also, Scott starts out with the following spells (All level 4 except Life, which is 1).
* Fire
* Blizzard
* Thunder
* Cure
* Life

This equipment and stats make him a Red Mage, and it should be noted that it is worthwile to have a Red Mage, considering you can specialize them this time. A useful character.
