With Team Rocket finally dispatching of their serparate groups, Team Magma and Aqua, an Aegislash, a Greninja and a Porygon are caught in the mess. Chapter 1:Lock your doors at night

A way to recover myself. That was the only thing that entered my mind when I entered the house. My blade had been scratched and the shield was cracked. Humans mostly have metal parts in their houses, and that is what I would need to recover my body. Little did I know that my shield made so much noise being dragged over the ground.

From the above part, you should have deducted that I'm an Aegislash, a Pokémon famous for it's special capability: To be able to safely dispatch of any foe. Sadly enough, the other well known fact about us, is that if we fail to let our target faint immediatley, we become extremely vulnerable. Me? Some would call me an old blade, but that would be false. I'm seventeen years old physically and around 50 mentally. I am a traveller, not having any house, trekking around to see the world. I came into that house after a group of angry Absol had been hunting me and roughed me up.

"What is that noise?" A young male came walking down the stairs. Not knowing where to hide myself, I decided to play dead. The strategy had saved me before, and is as good as any when you are out to defend yourself. This time it didn't work, as the human turned on the light. Deciding that if I wouldn't be able to hide, I decided to attack him. 

"BRING IT ON!"

"Oh for the love of... SOLARIS! You bumbling fool! You left the door open. A wild Pokémon has snuck in." the human said. "I didn't!" said a voice from above. The human groaned. "Like she's ever gonna admit to that. In any case, come on out Lethalshadow!" The human threw a Pokéball, and out of it popped a Greninja. "You had better reveal yourself, there is no hiding from me." was the thing it said when it came out of the ball.

"I WASN'T PLANNING TO" was my reply, and at the same time I revealed myself to the human.

"Ooh. A shiny Aegislash, those are extremely rare! Alright Eon, use Water Shuriken!"

Foolish human, announcing your attack won't do you anything good. It just lets your opponent dodge an attack more easily. I quickly switched to my Blade Forme and used Sacred Sword. The Greninja was thrown of guard by the force of the attack, but didn't faint. "Oh crap" Due to the fact that I didn't faint, the Water Shurikens hit me at full force, striking me all five times. At this point, the human readied a Pokéball. "no. please don't" Before I could react, the ball got thrown at me, and for a few seconds I was stuck inside a weird temporal mass, living outside of space and time. Then I heard a clicking sound and the mass dispersed, revealing a small area fit for me. However within moments I got thrown out of the ball, back into the house. Then I realised: I had been caught, from now on I would be an option for him to be send out whenever it would please him. No more freedom. That is something I would never have happen to me. I promised that many years ago, and now this foolish human has broken that. For now though, I decided, the human would be permitted have punishment delayed and would be permitted to live as I was too weak to defend myself.

"Look Aegislash, I don't hate you, and you look hurt. I needed to catch you, otherwise the Pokémon Center wouldn't accept you. I will always consider you my equal, just like I do with my other Pokémon. That being said, how about I give you a name?" 

A name? Oh dear Arceus no. Anything but that. Humans have the weirdest names for their Pokémon. I once met a Metapod named well... a rather curious name that would embarass any serious Pokémon trainer.

"How about... Misery?"

Misery? I've heard worse. Fine then, it shall be good enough for now.

"good enough for now"

"Alright Misery, I think you should at least meet Eon, he's the Greninja that you fought against."

"Hi! My name is Eon!" said the Greninja excitedly. "We're gonna be best friends!"

I decided to switch back to Shield Forme.

"I HAVE MY DOUBTS ABOUT THAT."

"Oh come on, I am sure that it will come out good. Lunaris is a friendly trainer, and he always treats his Pokémon with respect!" was the somewhat dulled reply.

"HOW MANY POKÉMON DOES LUNARIS HAVE?" was my retort.

"Er... me and Solius. Maybe you just need to sleep over it." was the answer.

"FINE. JUST DON'T EXPECT ME TO OPEN UP TO YOU AND GET ALL BUDDY BUDDY WITH YOU. I DON'T TRUST OTHERS THAT QUICKLY."

"Looks like you two are becoming good friends. Either way, it's late and I'm tired. Misery, I will send you to the Pokémon Center tomorrow. For now it's time to sleep." The human yawned. "Time to go in the Pokéball you two!"

The inside of the Pokéball had darkened and a small wooden rack and a bed appeared. Tired, I hang the Shield on the rack and lay down on the bed.

<strong> "Such a curious Aegislash you are. Getting caught after all these years of fleeing in your single moment of weakness."

"WHO ARE YOU?"

"The Pokémon that is haunting you. And to answer your question, no I am not Darkrai nor Cresselia. I watched you for a while now."

"ARE YOU THE FOOL THAT SEND THOSE ABSOL AFTER ME?"

"Probably. Absol appear when a disaster is about to hit. I guess they must have thought you were the disaster. Maybe someone told them that."

"GO OUT OF MY MIND OR YOU WILL REGRET IT!"

"What? You don't like me? I am just a powerful force, nothing else Aegislash. Or what does your TRAINER call you? Misery? Such a weak name for a weak Pokémon."

"I AM NOT A WEAK POKÉMON, NOW GET OUT OF MY MIND!"

"Fine. Look, I will go. But we will continue our conversation tomorrow. Happy dreams..."</strong>
