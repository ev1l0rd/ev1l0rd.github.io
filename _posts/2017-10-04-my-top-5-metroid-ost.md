Greetings fellow readers, gaming fans and/or folks who stumbled upon my blog! Today I want to talk a bit about the Metroid series. More specifically the soundtrack. Part of the core experience of any Metroid game is the atmosphere. The feeling that you are standing out there, all alone on some planet, with no allies except for the power suit that you are standing around. That is the feeling that Metroid should be evoking, and quite honestly, in a lot of ways, it truly has.

One of the biggest parts of this, even more than the ruins of lost civilizations Metroid throws at you, is the music. Certain areas would not have evoked the same atmosphere, had the soundwork for the games not have been so great. Some battles wouldn't have had the proper intensity if it weren't for the music.

Hence why I am going to list my Top 5 favorite Metroid Soundtracks. Note that as you should probably realize by now that these lists are my personal opinions and you may not neccesarily agree with them. That's fine, taste differs for everyone. That is what makes us unique. Anyway, time to stop beating around the bush: Let's do this, my Top 5 favorite Metroid soundtracks.

## No. 5 - Ridley's Theme (Other M)
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/efdWNCh4XhA?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Calling Other M a divisible game would be steering around the issue. Being by far and wide regarded as the second worst Metroid game (Federation Force was worse in my opinion due to simply lacking anything that made Metroid appealing, and while Other M was bad, I could still consciously call it a Metroid game without damaging my ethical standards), mostly due to issues with characterization around Samus and Adam Malkovich (who was characterized quite a bit differently in other materials but that is something for a different place and time). And of course... the infamous Ridley scene where Samus somehow gets reduced to a child when facing Ridley (and before any of you screechers can shout "but muh PTSD", I call bullshit based on several reasons: 1. Zero Mission showed Samus getting startled by Ridley, but not to the point of to which Other M goes to it. 2. She killed the fucking dragon 4 times by now, and this is a clone. Samus didn't flinch at Ridley X, another clone. 3. Other M has a whole bunch of other sexist/'Samus is weak' crap in it, and this scene basically acts as frosting on the shitcake. 4. PTSD is the cheap way out. Any argument I make here can be refuted by saying "BUT PTSD". There is a reason why video game characters often don't have PTSD: It's because it makes them (and consequentially the player) seem weak. If I want to feel weak, I look at real life. _Redefining_ the main character in a video game to be 'weak' and not getting over it near the end is basically character death and somewhere on the list of things you should never do when writing a story. 5. Finally, I'd just like to make this argument: By all standards, Samus is a superwoman, having suffered way worse than Ridley (loss of her second foster parents, the defilation and eventual destruction of her home planet, the destruction of another Chozo site, getting inflicted with a lethal disease, the list goes on), and this breaks her? Call me Shirley, but that just doesn't seem right.) Also, you don't even get to kill Ridley. The reborn Metroid Queen kills him off-screen. Sorry did I spoil you? Well I don't fucking give a shit. Other M has a story that is worse than dogcrap and quite honestly, you don't miss out by skipping it.

Wew. Kinda went on a tangent there. Dammit, this post isn't ["Why Other M, and in particular the Ridley scene sucks"](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/lb_i.php?lb_id=13373815860B43920100&i_id=13373815860I43921400&p=1). There are way better posters out there to dig those tunnels and infact, there is one right there.

Back to music. The music for Other M is mostly forgettable. Except for this theme. Holy shit this theme. Probably one of the best Ridley themes out there (barring Proteus Ridley, but I'm excluding that one since Proteus Ridleys' fight has 3 themes associated with it and they're all remixes of other Ridley themes). It is a loud, orchestral mix of Ridleys theme, while keeping in touch with the original series theme. Definetly a number five as far as I'm concerned.

## No. 4 - Theme of Super Metroid

This theme is just characteristic of the Metroid series nowadays. It starts out foreboding, before going into triumphant high notes. It plays over the introduction of Super Metroid. What makes this song truly stand out is how it feels like you are at the beginning of something awesome, and that is exactly what it is.

That which prevents it from getting in the top three is the fact that while the song is a great piece of work and is probably the third most recognized theme in the series, it's just a bit too old. While Super Metroid is one of the few SNES games that stood the test of time to modern day (well mostly, physics feel a bit clunky and there are a few oddities here and there and _fuck the grapple beam_), the music just pales in comparison to the other entries on the list.

## No. 3 - Big Boss Confrontation 2 - Super Metroid

Alternative title: Theme that plays when a fat man walks into a bar and orders the entire menu.

The theme associated with Kraid, Phantoon and Crocomire, BBC2 is one of the three boss themes (the other ones being BBC1 which is used for Draygon and Ridley and Spore Spawns theme which is used for, well, Spore Spawn and the forgettable snake miniboss in Maridia). It sadly was not reused for Other M, but that might be a good thing since Other M's soundtrack was not the greatest. It did have a lower paced mix in Kraid's boss fight in Zero Mission though.

It's a heavy theme, that appears generally whenever you fight a big alien. Although most people associate it with either Kraid or Crocomire, the track to me always felt more like it belonged to Phantoon.

## No. 2 - 

## No. 1 - Rundas' Boss Fight

## Runner-ups
These are some tracks that I didn't pick, but are awesome and worth listening to nonetheless:

- [Thardus Battle (Metroid Prime)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3cXUxMCyjQ) - It's kinda like Rundas' theme but less climactic. Also accompanied by an amazing fight.
