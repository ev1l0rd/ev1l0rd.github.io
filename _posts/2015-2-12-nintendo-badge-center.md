"i can't afford to not care anymore."

sans (Undertale)

So for once I'm going to put up my serious face and gonna discuss something important. Nintendo. Although I've been ignoring the company's rather unwise decisions, I think right now is a good time to discuss something that I've been angered by for a long time.

{% include series.html %}

The format
==========
The following series will be done in a rather interesting manner. I'm gonna use a few words that you may want to know.
* Accused: The part I'm critizising
* Exhibit X: Evidence for this criticism.

In the part of the accused... there is the Nintendo Badge Center!
=================================================================
The Nintendo Badge Center is an app for the Nintendo 3DS that was added in a recent update. It is a crane like mini-game where you can collect badges to put on display on your homescreen.

Will continue soon.
